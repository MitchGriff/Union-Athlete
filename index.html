            <p>
              Union Athlete specializes in fitness programming and coaching designed to forge unbreakable athletes. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Creating Union Athlete was an opportunity to bring the best of what our coaching staff does from an athlete development standpoint together with our simple philosophy: Design a plan of attack for each athlete, help expose and overcome weaknesses, and outwork the competition. This process forces athletes to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, and ultimately produces the greatest amount of growth for them. Like the anvil logo, we serve as the foundation for each athlete to face the fire of daily training, and help forge them into something stronger and sharper than they were before.  Our motto is <q>Nil Sine Labore,</q> translates as <q>Nothing without labor.</q> Union Athlete embodies the working class mentality when it comes to training and competing. When the lights come on we&#39ll be prepared to win, and when the dust settles you can bet we&#39ll still be standing.
